/* 

For body the format should be like this :

type,posx,posy,direction,duration,time

Explaination : 

- Type has two integers, either 0 or 1, with 0 is swipe, and 1 is hold
- Posx and posy means the position x and position y
- Direction means which direction will you have to swipe to
- Duration is for hold only, fill in 0 for swipe, means how long do we have to hold the note before swiping it
- Time means when the note will be instantiated, in other words, where the note will be seen in the screen
